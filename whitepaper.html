        <h1>Preuro Whitepaper</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #8892B0; margin-bottom: 50px;">v1.0 - June 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
        <p>Preuro is a decentralized monetary ecosystem built on the Solana blockchain, designed to challenge the inefficiencies and instability of modern centralized finance. Inspired by F. A. Hayek's concept of the "Denationalisation of Money," Preuro introduces a competitive currency environment by digitally restoring Europe's historic national currencies. The ecosystem is powered by its central utility and governance token, <strong>$PREU</strong>, which has a fixed, immutable supply. Through a system of community governance and token holder rewards, Preuro aims to restore monetary choice, preserve cultural heritage, and provide a stable foundation for a new era of economic freedom in Europe.</p>

        <h2>2. Introduction: The Problem with Modern Monetary Systems</h2>
        <p>For decades, citizens have operated within a system of monopolistic, government-controlled fiat currency. While intended to provide stability, this model has consistently demonstrated significant flaws:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Central banks possess the authority to create new money at will, leading to a persistent and silent erosion of purchasing power, effectively acting as a tax on savings.</li>
            <li><strong>Instability:</strong> Monetary policy is often influenced by short-term political goals rather than long-term economic health, leading to cycles of boom and bust.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss of Identity:</strong> The adoption of a single currency across diverse nations, such as the Euro, has led to a loss of monetary heritage and the unique economic identities that currencies like the Mark, Lira, and Drachma once represented.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Preuro is founded on the belief that the path to stable, honest money lies not in monopoly, but in competition.</p>

        <h2>3. The Preuro Solution: The Denationalisation of Money</h2>
        <p>Preuro implements Nobel laureate F. A. Hayek's vision by creating a decentralized ecosystem where multiple currencies can coexist and compete. Instead of imposing a single new currency, Preuro facilitates the rebirth of currencies trusted for generations.</p>
        <p>Our solution is built on two pillars:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>A Stable Foundation:</strong> The $PREU token, with its fixed and immutable supply, acts as the stable, predictable core of the ecosystem, free from the risk of inflationary manipulation.</li>
            <li><strong>A Competitive Marketplace:</strong> By reintroducing historic currencies as digital tokens, we allow the market and the community to choose the currencies that best serve their needs as a medium of exchange and store of value.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>4. The Preuro Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>The ecosystem is composed of 10 digital assets in total, creating a rich and diverse monetary environment.</p>
        <h4>4.1. The Central Token: $PREU</h4>
        <p>$PREU is the heart of the ecosystem, designed with three primary functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Governance:</strong> $PREU holders vote to decide which historic currency will be the next to be launched within the ecosystem.</li>
            <li><strong>Utility:</strong> Holding $PREU is a prerequisite for receiving airdrops of newly launched historic currencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Store of Value:</strong> With a permanently fixed supply, $PREU is designed to be a deflationary asset and a reliable store of value against the inflation of fiat currencies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>4.2. The Historic Currencies</h4>
        <p>The ecosystem will progressively launch 9 of Europe's most iconic historic currencies. The initial list of planned currencies includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>German Mark (Deutsche Mark)</li>
            <li>Italian Lira</li>
            <li>Portuguese Escudo</li>
            <li>French Franc</li>
            <li>Spanish Peseta</li>
            <li>Dutch Guilder</li>
            <li>Greek Drachma</li>
            <li>Austrian Schilling</li>
            <li>Irish Punt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Tokenomics</h2>
        <p>The economic model of $PREU is designed for transparency, scarcity, and long-term stability.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Token Name:</strong> Preuro</li>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> $PREU</li>
            <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Solana</li>
            <li><strong>Contract Address:</strong> <code>hn3ZJEYFpPQUgTyQrpVWuGP95PDNXeCLYVLbqkGa4ks</code></li>
            <li><strong>Decimals:</strong> 6</li>
            <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 1,000,000,000 $PREU</li>
            <li><strong>Supply Status:</strong> Immutable. Both the mint and update authorities have been permanently revoked.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>5.1. Token Allocation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ecosystem Fund:</strong> 40% (400,000,000 $PREU) - Dedicated to community rewards, including airdrops, future staking incentives, and contests.</li>
            <li><strong>Liquidity Provision:</strong> 20% (200,000,000 $PREU) - To be used to create the initial trading pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</li>
            <li><strong>Strategic Reserve:</strong> 20% (200,000,000 $PREU) - A reserve fund for future strategic opportunities, such as major exchange listings or unforeseen developments.</li>
            <li><strong>Team:</strong> 10% (100,000,000 $PREU) - For the founding team, subject to a 2-year vesting schedule to ensure long-term commitment.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing & Development:</strong> 10% (100,000,000 $PREU) - To fund ongoing marketing campaigns, partnerships, and future ecosystem development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Core Mechanics</h2>
        <h4>6.1. Community Governance</h4>
        <p>Once a year, a formal vote will be held among all $PREU holders. The vote will present a choice of remaining historic currencies to be launched. The currency with the most votes will be the next to be developed and integrated into the ecosystem. Voting power will be proportional to the amount of $PREU held.</p>
        <h4>6.2. Airdrop System</h4>
        <p>Prior to the public launch of each new historic currency, a snapshot will be taken of all wallets holding $PREU. A portion of the new currency's supply will be distributed for free (airdropped) to these wallets, rewarding long-term supporters of the ecosystem.</p>

        <h2>7. Roadmap</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phase 1: Foundation (Completed ?)</strong> - Concept, Philosophy, and Ecosystem defined. $PREU token created and made fully immutable. Initial online presence established. Official Whitepaper v1.0 released.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 2: Community & Liquidity (Current Phase ?)</strong> - Organic growth of social media communities. Creation of the initial liquidity pool on a Solana DEX. Official public trading launch of $PREU. Submission for listing on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion (Future ???)</strong> - First community vote to select the first historic currency. Launch of the first historic currency, including airdrop. Development of a $PREU staking mechanism. Continuation of the annual cycle of voting and launching new historic currencies.</li>
        </ul>
